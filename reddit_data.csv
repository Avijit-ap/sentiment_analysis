1,"The fact that there are new discounts every hour, every day, ensures that people can not club together their orders. And then there are different discount coupons on different items. I placed three different orders back to back within minutes to segregate by coupons and get the max benefit. Got charged 10 rupees convenience fee on each, which didn't matter because savings were more. I don't mind doing this. But Myntra could deploy those fancy algos they've used to charge various fees to different accounts basis their shopping history, to solving the problem of clubbing together orders. Give customers the option to get all products at once if they are ready to wait. Ensure adequate packaging so wastage is reduced. Make sure your suppliers have inventory to honour the sales so you don't disappoint your customers. And lastly, have more intelligent CS. These folks are just doing their jobs. Equip them with better scripts, empower them with more options. And of course ban the folks from your platform who abuse their CS executives. Pay more attention to trends coming out of CS tickets and solve for them. Right now Myntra is not behaving like a mature 10yr old platform it is, but more like a newbie that's breaking at the surge of orders, like they didn't prep their logistics well. Big success for their tech and marketing, total bungle up in operations.",10-06-2023 07:49
2,"I have stopped using Myntra completely. Size charts are not accurate, they send damaged makeup products , fake puma (other brands) shoes too.. so much nonsense lately!",10-06-2023 06:11
3,"I am getting these prompts multiple times, and somehow it feels so patronizing, idk probably I am reading too much into it, but it has started to annoy me now. Also,

if you click on the information tab against the convenience fee, what they've written makes no sense to me.",10-06-2023 06:41
4,I think tagging on twitter etc is a better move than ranting here tbh. Why dont we voice our concerns of different convenience fees levying on diffferent accounts? So tired of all this charades tbh.,10-06-2023 06:35
5,"Myntra is as moody as it comes. Last year they charged me Rs.100 cos my returns were high, when in reality i had barely any returns. I think they got a lot of backlash and one day the whole fee suddenly disappeared without any trace?



The whole convenience fee came right in time of sale see, we are known to place multiple orders instead of a  one big single order. Any cancellation by you or them will let them pocket the Rs. 10. That must be a lot of 10s to pocket.


The whole thing is a sham. If they really did care about carbon footprint and us being a responsible shopper they wouldn't do what they do. 


This is my fav story to tell, so i ordered 2 deo roll ons from myntra months back, it came in a box, when i got the box i didn't notice the leakage on the other end so as usual i opened the box to see the deos crushed inside the plastic cover and it was leaking. When i say crushed i mean it was a torn bag of tiny glass shards. 


I took a picture sent it to cs, they told me i need to 'return it to get refund'. I explained to them that it's a bag of glass, cardboard is soaked and i don't want anyone cutting their hand in glass when it goes back, so it's safe i dispose it off, you have pictures as proof. But no, they spent 20 mins on call arguing i have to send them the bag of glass to get refund or they won't process it. I did send it back and hoped no one got their hands injured. Now if they really cared about being responsible, think they'd do that?


Edit - how did i forget about the fakes. I received fake products not once but thrice! I had to mail them countless times, attaching the proof and even then they were reluctant to accept that they sent me a fake. Don't even get me started on the accuracy of clothing sizes, it's inconsistent across the brands. 


And before you myntra minions attack me, it's not an isolated incident. Myntra takes back broken glass item including bbw candles to issue refund. So yeah I'm salty enough to say fuck you myntra.",10-06-2023 06:10
6,They have disabled my COD due to returns nd charging me 30rs fee,10-06-2023 09:57

8,"Idk about you guys but a convenience fees of 10 is only on cod not on prepaid ones .. which a lot of others companies also charge nowdays .. gone are the days of free cod üò¢
Actually this trend of return was started by stupid influencers who used to buy clothes click pics for insta then return . 
I know a lot of my girls in my hostel who did the same .. wore a dress for a night fest clicked pics then returned them all sweaty and used . Eww .. we are facing the brunt of these morons .
.
But they should charge this penalty fees account wise not for us who have hardly any returns .. it is annoying .",10-06-2023 08:09
9,People have a problem with every little thing these days XD,10-06-2023 06:09
10,I don't think this is a sub to post all this. Please keep all these posts for the skincare addicts sub.This is so annoying. Why can't people understand basic sub division?,10-06-2023 07:19
11,Can anyone help me with myntra's customer care number please. I have a payment related issue. The call us option on the apl takes me to an automated call i don't want that I need to talk to a human. Please help me.,10-06-2023 07:31
12,They keep showing me this everyday ü§£ü•π,10-06-2023 07:32
13,"They are really trying hard to be like a stingy person by all these tactics. First convenience fee, then cod charges and now constantly reminding that you can replace item before ordering instead of cancelling or exchange instead of returning the item. They really want to keep our money at any cost",11-06-2023 11:45
14,"Myntra is doing this because Indians blatantly misuse the return policy of the store thus leading to huge losses.I work at Amazon and I don't know where to begin as to how Indians misuse the return policy of these e-commerce companies.I have even seen people wearing new dresses,hiding their tags while outside with their jackets or dupatta and then return them after they have already worn the new dress.This is the return why Indian sites are now more wary of their customers.",11-06-2023 13:39
15,Y'all I'm a banned Myntra user and they banned me cuz of returns and I had low return rate even then.no prompt came before they went ahead with this action. No customer service or review on Play Store helped. The company thinks it is bigger than the user while the users have made it such big,01-08-2023 08:15
