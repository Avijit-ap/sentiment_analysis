A particular size may be available only on one place (because of demand and supply) and can thus be delivered to a nearby location only at the deep discount that's usually desired. And the situation is dynamic and can change soon after you order as well (so may well have changed from the time you first ordered to the time you want to request an exchange). So, if they have an XL side of a thing only in their Gurgaon factory.warehouse, a Delhi-NCR customer can very well get it, but for a Bengaluru customer can't. It usually happens more for less prevalent sizes (slow-moving stock unit) or area codes that are somewhat off the beaten path. Also, just because one size of a product is available for delivery to one location doesn't mean other sizes are as well.\\n\\nIn this case, return is an option. Exercise it.\\n\\nKnowing one's size and using size charts given on the site and on the supplier's page helps mitigate this problem. Also, enter your pincode while browsing only rather than only during checkout. If when going on the product page for the first time, many sizes are showing unavailable in your location, chances are an exchange problem may come up in the future.\", 'Just return the product and order another of the different size using a credit card or whatever?
